A simple GUI solution for running Recaf.

## Usage

Run the jar file to open the GUI. The first time using the launcher, you will be asked how this launcher should behave.
You have the options of:

- Showing the launcher every time
- Updating and running Recaf _(without showing the launcher)_
- Just running Recaf without updating _(and without showing the launcher)_

If you wish to reset the behavior after picking one of the last two options, delete the `%RECAF%/launcher` directory where `%RECAF%` is where Recaf is installed on your system.
